# Meta Hosts
**I'm taking over the excellent [facebook-extended.txt](https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts/blob/master/docs/lists/facebook-extended.txt) hosts list after his repo is archived.**

## PR Contributions
The list is in alphabetical order. After cloning this repository, copy the `meta-hosts.txt` file, for example to `~/Documents`. Apply the changes and run the command:

```sh
sort -u Documents/meta-hosts.txt > PATH_CLONED_REPO_/meta-hosts.txt
```

## Special Thanks
Thank you @lightswitch05 for your work.
