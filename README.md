# Meta Hosts
**I'm taking over the excellent [facebook-extended.txt](https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts/blob/master/docs/lists/facebook-extended.txt) hosts list after his repo is archived.**

## Contributions
* **In case you find a domain that is not listed in the `domains` file:**
You can add it to this file, which is sorted alphabetically. I'd search for valid sub-domains.

* **If you find a valid sub-domain that is not blocked:**
You can create the `manual` file, if not already present and add it to this new file in HOSTS format.
It will be sorted alphabetically too.

* **Otherwise, if you're not familiar with `git` , you can also open an ISSUE.**

## Special Thanks
Thank you @lightswitch05 for your work.
